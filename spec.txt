Phase 1: Bible Typing App

OVERVIEW:
A minimal Bible typing app that allows the user to type through the entire Bible,
tracking WPM and accuracy per chapter.

TECHNOLOGY:
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Progress stored in localStorage

BIBLE API:
- Use bible-api.com (free, no authentication required)
- Let user choose version: KJV, ASV, or WEB
- Do not display verse/chapter numbers in typing content

USER INTERFACE:
- Clean minimalist design (lots of whitespace, subtle colors, text-focused)
- Dark/light theme toggle
- WPM meter (standard calculation: characters typed / 5 / minutes elapsed)
- Accuracy meter (correct characters / total characters typed)

TYPING MECHANICS:
- Show errors inline: continue typing, highlight incorrect characters in red
- Allow backspace correction (errors still counted for accuracy)
- Visual feedback: correct = normal, incorrect = red highlight

NAVIGATION:
- Linear progression only (Genesis to Revelation)
- Must complete chapters in order
- Cannot skip ahead

PROGRESS TRACKING:
- Store WPM and accuracy per chapter in localStorage
- Track daily streak (consecutive days with practice)
- Store current position (book/chapter)

WPM CALCULATION:
- Standard method: (characters typed / 5) / minutes elapsed
- Start timer on first keypress

ACCURACY CALCULATION:
- (correct keystrokes / total keystrokes) * 100
